        <h1>Typography</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Oliver Reichenstein said that web design is 95% typography, so it
        seems fitting to have a whole page of this design system dedicated to
        demonstrating its typographic hierarchy.</p>
      <p>The body typeface stack is <a href="{{ typography.families.body.helvetica.url }}">{{ typography.families.body.helvetica }}</a>,
        by {{ typography.families.body.helvetica.designer }}, followed by
        <a href="{{ typography.families.body.arial.url }}">{{ typography.families.body.arial }}</a>,
        by {{ typography.families.body.arial.designer }}.</p>
      <p>The primary heading above is {{ typography.styles.h1.size }} with
        {{ typography.styles.h1.weight }} weight.</p>
      <h2>Secondary Heading</h2>
      <p>The secondary heading above is {{ typography.styles.h2.size }} with
        {{ typography.styles.h2.weight }} weight.</p>
      <h3>Tertiary Heading</h3>
      <p>The tertiary heading above is {{ typography.styles.h3.size }} with
        {{ typography.styles.h3.weight }} weight.</p>
      <h4>Quarternary Heading</h4>
      <p>The quarternary heading above is {{ typography.styles.h4.size }} with
        {{ typography.styles.h4.weight }} weight.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This is an item in an unordered list.</li>
        <li>This is an especially long item in an unordered list, with text
          that will wrap to multiple lines due to its length.</li>
        <li>
          This item includes its own unordered sublist.
          <ul>
            <li>This is an item in a sublist.</li>
            <li>This item is nested within two unordered lists.</li>
            <li>This is the last itme in the sublist.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          This item also has a sublist, but it&rsquo;s an ordered list, rather
          than an unordered list.
          <ol>
            <li>This is the first item in a sublist.</li>
            <li>This item comes second.</li>
            <li>And last but not least is this item.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Word processors &mdash; especially early word processors &mdash;
          could not handle hanging indentation, so they indented lists as a
          compromise with technical feasibility. In fact, hanging punctuation
          is typographically correct and, despite how &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; it
          may feel now, easier to read, because it maintains a consistent left
          margin to the text.
          <ul>
            <li>All that said, we <em>do</em> have to indent sublists.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, they&rsquo;ll lose all visual distinction, and you
              won&rsquo;t be able to tell items in the sublist from those in
              the parent list.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>This list is identical to the one above in every regard but two:
          this first item is different, and it&rsquo;s an ordered list instead
          of an unordered list.</li>
        <li>This is an especially long item in an unordered list, with text
          that will wrap to multiple lines due to its length.</li>
        <li>
          This item includes its own unordered sublist.
          <ul>
            <li>This is an item in a sublist.</li>
            <li>This item is nested within two unordered lists.</li>
            <li>This is the last itme in the sublist.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

          This item also has a sublist, but it&rsquo;s an ordered list, rather
