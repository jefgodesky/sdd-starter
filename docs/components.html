          <li>Links <em>go places</em>, while <a href="#component-button">buttons</a>
            <em>do things</em>. The difference is that buttons change the state
            of the website. That can be on the server side or the client side,
            but a button implies that some action is being taken, and something,
            somewhere is different now. Links take you somewhere else, but
            neither the place you were nor the place you&rsquo;re going have
            changed when you do so.</li>
          <li>Yes, buttons are routinely abused to work as just bigger, more
            prominent links &mdash; usually along with other bad design
            decisions that visually mark almost all of the items on a page as
            the most important thing, creating frustration and increasing the
            user&rsquo;s cognitive load. It&rsquo;s a terrible practice, and
            just because it&rsquo;s common is no reason to do it.</li>
          <li>In places where you might be tempted to use a button to go
            somewhere because the link should be visually prominent, consider
            using the <a href="#component-cta">prominent link</a>
            component instead. Just remember: if <em>everything</em> is
            visually prominent, then <em>nothing</em> is.</li>
          <li>If you need to present the user with a prominent decision point
            when she could go to any of several different places, and each one
            calls for some significant explanation, you might consider the
            <a href="#component-panel">panel link</a> component.</li>
