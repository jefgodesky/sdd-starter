          <li>Links <em>go places</em>, while <a href="#component-button">buttons</a>
            <em>do things</em>. The difference is that buttons change the state
            of the website. That can be on the server side or the client side,
            but a button implies that some action is being taken, and something,
            somewhere is different now. Links take you somewhere else, but
            neither the place you were nor the place you&rsquo;re going have
            changed when you do so.</li>
          <li>Yes, buttons are routinely abused to work as just bigger, more
            prominent links &mdash; usually along with other bad design
            decisions that visually mark almost all of the items on a page as
            the most important thing, creating frustration and increasing the
            user&rsquo;s cognitive load. It&rsquo;s a terrible practice, and
            just because it&rsquo;s common is no reason to do it.</li>
          <li>In places where you might be tempted to use a button to go
            somewhere because the link should be visually prominent, consider
            using the <a href="#component-cta">prominent link</a>
            component instead. Just remember: if <em>everything</em> is
            visually prominent, then <em>nothing</em> is.</li>
          <li>If you need to present the user with a prominent decision point
            when she could go to any of several different places, and each one
            calls for some significant explanation, you might consider the
            <a href="#component-panel">panel link</a> component.</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="component-cta" class="component" data-component-category="Navigation">
        <h2>Call to Action</h2>
        <div class="example">
          <a href="#component-cta" class="cta">Call to Action</a>
        </div>
        <details>
          <summary>Markup</summary>
          <code class="block language-html">&lt;a href="#" class="cta"&gt;Call to Action&lt;/a&gt;</code>
        </details>
        <ul class="notes">
          <li>Use this component when you want to give users the opportunity to
            <em>go somewhere</em> (meaning that they’re not changing the
            website back-end or front-end), but the link should be visually
            prominent.</li>
          <li>This component is suitable as a call to action where the
            <em>action</em> is to <em>go somewhere</em>, rather than to
            <em>do something</em>. As with other calls to action, you should
            not have more than one on a page. The user can only do one
            thing; if you ask hen to do several things, you only create
            confusion and frustration.</li>
          <li>Like any other option that creates visual prominence, do not
            overuse this component. Generally speaking, you should not use
            this more than once on a page. Visual hierarchy helps create
            clarity, unless you try to make everything prominent, then there
            is no hierarchy and no clarity, because everything is equally
            prominent. It’s the design equivalent of writing in all caps
            or shouting at someone.</li>
          <li>If the call to action <em>does</em> do something (changing the
            state of the website, either on the front-end or the back-end),
            then you should use a <a href="#component-button">button</a>
            instead.</li>
