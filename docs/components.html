          <li>Links <em>go places</em>, while <a href="#component-button">buttons</a>
            <em>do things</em>. The difference is that buttons change the state
            of the website. That can be on the server side or the client side,
            but a button implies that some action is being taken, and something,
            somewhere is different now. Links take you somewhere else, but
            neither the place you were nor the place you&rsquo;re going have
            changed when you do so.</li>
          <li>Yes, buttons are routinely abused to work as just bigger, more
            prominent links &mdash; usually along with other bad design
            decisions that visually mark almost all of the items on a page as
            the most important thing, creating frustration and increasing the
            user&rsquo;s cognitive load. It&rsquo;s a terrible practice, and
            just because it&rsquo;s common is no reason to do it.</li>
          <li>In places where you might be tempted to use a button to go
            somewhere because the link should be visually prominent, consider
            using the <a href="#component-cta">prominent link</a>
            component instead. Just remember: if <em>everything</em> is
            visually prominent, then <em>nothing</em> is.</li>
          <li>If you need to present the user with a prominent decision point
            when she could go to any of several different places, and each one
            calls for some significant explanation, you might consider the
            <a href="#component-panel">panel link</a> component.</li>

        <h2>Call to Action</h2>
        <div class="example">

        <ul class="notes">
          <li>Use this component when you want to give users the opportunity to
            <em>go somewhere</em> (meaning that they’re not changing the
            website back-end or front-end), but the link should be visually
            prominent.</li>
          <li>This component is suitable as a call to action where the
            <em>action</em> is to <em>go somewhere</em>, rather than to
            <em>do something</em>. As with other calls to action, you should
            not have more than one on a page. The user can only do one
            thing; if you ask hen to do several things, you only create
            confusion and frustration.</li>
          <li>Like any other option that creates visual prominence, do not
            overuse this component. Generally speaking, you should not use
            this more than once on a page. Visual hierarchy helps create
            clarity, unless you try to make everything prominent, then there
            is no hierarchy and no clarity, because everything is equally
            prominent. It’s the design equivalent of writing in all caps
            or shouting at someone.</li>
          <li>If the call to action <em>does</em> do something (changing the
            state of the website, either on the front-end or the back-end),
            then you should use a <a href="#component-button">button</a>
            instead.</li>

          <li>Do <strong>not</strong> use placeholders in place of
            <a href="#component-label">labels</a>. When you begin typing in a
            text box, the text disappears, so if you forget precisely what you
            need to enter in this box, you’ll need to remove what
            you’ve written. Placeholders aren’t designed to take
            the place of labels; that’s what labels are for. Placeholders
            should be used to provide an example of the sort of input a user
            should provide in the box.</li>
          <li>The text input is the most generic of the fields provided here.
            This is appropriate for fields that need to collect a piece of
            arbitrary short text. Wherever appropriate, use one of the more
            specific fields detailed here. The text input is the default option
            that you can use when none of the other options quite fit. When
            asking the user for text that you expect to exceed more than a
            dozen or so characters, use the <a href="#component-textarea">text area</a>
            component instead.</li>
          <li>The email input is the field you should use when you ask the
            user to enter an email address. Though this may look the same on a
            desktop browser, the specialized field can prompt a variety of
            affordances. For example, on iOS Safari, the email field brings up
            a different keyboard, with special <em>@</em> and <em>.com</em>
            buttons that make typing an email address more convenient.</li>
          <li>The search input is the field you should use when you ask the
            user to enter a search query.</li>
          <li>The telephone input is the field you should use if you ever
            need to ask the user to enter a telephone number.</li>
          <li>The URL input is the field you should use when you ask the
            user to enter a URL.</li>
          <li>The number input is the field you should use when you ask the
            user to enter a number.</li>
          <li>Never ask for more data than you actually need. Every additional
            field on a form increases the interaction cost, reducing the
            likelihood that you’ll get any response at all. Interrogate
            every field to determine if it’s something you really need,
            and eliminate everything that is not absolutely necessary in order
            to provide the service that you wish to provide.</li>

          <li>Though rare exceptions might exist, it’s a good starting
            point to assume that <em>all</em> form elements <em>must</em> have
            labels. If you think you might have a legitimate exception, spend
            some time really thinking about where a label could go.</li>
          <li>Do <strong>not</strong> use placeholders in place of labels. When
            you begin typing in a text box, the text disappears, so if you

            for. Placeholders should be used to provide an example of the sort
            of input a user should provide in the box.</li>
          <li>It is critically important that error messages be written in as
            clear and concise a manner as possible. They should make it clear
            to the user, in approachable, everyday language, why the error
            occurred and what options the user has to rectify it.</li>

        </details>
        <ul class="notes">
          <li>The text area input is appropriate when you’re asking a
            user to enter a significant amount of text (anything more than a
            dozen or so characters). For short bits of text, you can use a
            <a href="#component-input">text input</a> field.</li>
          <li>Just like other form elements, text areas should appear with a
            concise and informative <a href="#component-label">label</a>.</li>
          <li>If a text area has a maximum number of permitted characters, you
            can add it to the <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> tag with the
            <code>maxlength</code> attribute. In most browsers, this will make
            it impossible for users to enter illegal values. This will also
            prompt the character counter enhancement, as demonstrated above.
            Character limits should generally follow from the nature of the
            data being entered, rather than arbitrary cut-offs, which could
            stop users from entering full, complete answers.</li>
