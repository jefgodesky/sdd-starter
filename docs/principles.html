        <h1>Values</h1>
        <p>This is just a starter, so I can&rsquo;t tell you what your design
          values should be, except that you should have them. If you don&rsquo;t
          yet, spend some time thinking about them. Articulating what it is that
          you value &mdash; and just as importantly, what you
          <em>don&rsquo;t</em> &mdash; is critical, foundational design work.
          You&rsquo;ve probably heard that &ldquo;design is intent.&rdquo; Well,
          knowing and being able to articulate your design values is a crucial
          part of making that intent clear. If you&rsquo;re clear about what your
          values are, and you understand the problem in front of you, in the vast
          majority of situations, the solution is clear.</p>
        <h2>Insert Value Here</h2>
        <p>You probably <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> go for values like, &ldquo;keep
          things simple,&rdquo; or &ldquo;communicate clearly.&rdquo; Those are
          universal rules of good design. Rather, think about the values that
          are important to this system that you <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em>
          necessarily follow in a different context &mdash; or what values
          might be really important somewhere else that don&rsquo;t apply here.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="principles">
        <h1>Principles</h1>
        <p>Where design values are high-level and abstract, principles are a
          bit more down to earth. Design principles are, if not <em>rules</em>
          exactly, then something a bit stronger than guidelines. There may
          well be times and places when you should break them, but you should
          never break them without a good reason.</p>
        <h2>Insert Principle Here</h2>
        <p>Like values, a good way to think of your design principles is in
          terms of the great ideas that you would follow without hesitation
          somewhere else, but not for this system.</p>
